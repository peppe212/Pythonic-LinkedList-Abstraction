Description:
-------------
This module defines the `Node` class used as the core building block
of the DoublyLinkedList data structure. Each node stores a single value
along with references to both the next and previous nodes in the sequence.

The design supports bidirectional traversal, enabling efficient operations
such as insertion and deletion at both ends and at arbitrary positions.

Note:
    This class is intended for internal use within the DoublyLinkedList
    and should not be accessed directly outside the list context.
